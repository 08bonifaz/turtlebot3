# Turtlebot3

TurtleBot3 is a small, low足cost, fully programmable, ROS足 based mobile robot. It is intended for use in education, research, product prototyping, and hobby applications.

Our goal with TurtleBot3 is to dramatically reduce the size and cost of the platform without sacrificing capability, functionality, or quality. Furthermore, we aim for TurtleBot 3 to offer more options for customization in the mechanical structure, the computer, and the sensor(s). These goals are achievable today because of significant recent advances in single足board computers, depth sensors, and rapid prototyping (e.g., 3足D printing).
